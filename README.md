- This project was built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#:~:text=svelte%2Dts-,Scaffolding%20Your%20First%20Vite%20Project,-%23). Vite is a modern frontend tooling that improves the dev server start time by first dividing the modules in an application into two categories: dependencies and source code, thereby making it faster to create a React application.
